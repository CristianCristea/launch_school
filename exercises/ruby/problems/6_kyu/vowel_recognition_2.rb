# Given a string of length N, the number of substrings that can be formed=N(N+1)/2

# The idea is to use a prefix sum array-based technique where we store the occurrences of each character in all the substrings concatenated.

#! store how many times a char appears in all substrings

# For the first character,
# no. of occurrences = no. of substrings starting with the first character = N.

# For each of the following characters, we store the
# no. of substrings starting with that character + the number of substrings formed by the previous characters containing this character â€“ the number of substrings formed by the previous characters only.
